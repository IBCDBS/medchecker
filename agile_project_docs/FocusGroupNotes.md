###IBC Employee Focus Group Notes/Summary

#####Attendees: JP Foley, Dan Maguire, Tim Spadafore, Blair Todd, Courtney Bristow (Product Owner), James Fintal (Delivery Manager) 

<i>What information from the FDA would be beneficial to you with respect to prescription and non-prescription drugs?</i> 

<b>Blair</b> - Interactions with other drugs, side-effects, dosing information, warnings (i.e. what to take and not to take with them) 

<b>Tim</b> - How often you need to take the drug? Side-Effects of the drugs, allergic reactions 

<b>Dan</b> - Family History and how it plays into, nervousness about addiction to drugs, is it similar for children and adults? 

<b>JP</b> - With four girls, my concern is one of my girls, particularly Hanna, accidentally taking someone else’s prescription.  I want to know what happens if that occurs, what should I look out for, what is the risk, what are my options 

<i>JP brings up an interesting point, as parents what are your fears for your children? </i>

<b>Tim</b> - with a toddler, I think my biggest fear is Henley ingesting something on-purpose, which is really accidental, and having an adverse reaction to it - what do I do 

<b>JP</b> - I think for me the key is risks related to specific drugs and what are the potential things that could occur, how safe are the drugs 

<b>Blair</b> - That Piper will get sick, taking too much, what are adverse effects,  

<i>As a group, is there anything else that worries you with respect to drugs?</i>

<b>Blair</b> - I want to know alternatives, is there a better drug than being prescribed, research behind effectiveness of the drug 

<b>Dan</b> - Is there anything else out there I need to know. Those sheets you get from the doctor are fine, but those are after the fact…I wish I was better prepared going into my kid’s appointment 

<i>But you could just surf the web for that?</i>

<b>Dan</b> - Sure, but if I goto WebMD, then they only post the worse possible scenario - as an example, my child is experiencing diziness and is vomiting - the response is to immediately rush to hospital, when maybe it's not that critical

<b>Tim</b> - Right, but the web applications are pretty complex, and you have to drill down to 20 different things - if that information was at my fingertips, that would be much more effective

<b>Blair</b> - You could, but which websites are the best, which ones are marketing, which ones provide value, something that was officially from FDA would be very helpful

<b>JP</b> - That is true, a pharmaceutical company would focus only on their drugs, would be hard to compare, and they would not want to explain generics 

<i>Is there anything else? </i>

<b>Tim</b> - I think I would want to know seriousness of each symptom - how bad is one vs. the other, is one symptom worse? 

<b>Blair</b> - no, I think those are the critical items and Tim just hit the big one 

<b>JP</b> - I think relevance is important - if this drug has no or few side effects locally, that says a lot about lifestyle 

<b>Dan</b> - No, I think that covers it
