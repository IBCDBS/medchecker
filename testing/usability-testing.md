#Usability Testing

Usability tests were conducted throughout the prototype development process in two different ways. First, the team had multiple potential end users review design templates and functionality samples for the core components of the application. These users included other IBC employees that were not part of the agile delivery team, as well as external users, typically family members of IBC employees. By conducting these usability tests frequently, the agile team was able to identify areas of improvement that could be incorporated within the current Sprint, or included in the backlog.

Second, our agile team included a Functional Tester role. As seen in our ALM tool, each User Story and bug included a Functional Testing sub-task on it. The tester helped to create acceptance criteria, and created the test plan to validate those acceptance criteria documented with each story. Once development was completed, the story would move into the tester’s queue, and he would execute the functional test, capture results, and then work directly with the developer to explain any anomalies in the results vs. acceptance criteria. To ensure that the layout, design, and functionality of the prototype achieved the needs and expectations of the end users based upon the acceptance criteria provided, screenshots were taken by the Functional Tester and attached to that User Story in Jira prior to Product Owner Review/Approval. The Product Owner would then consult the tester and artifacts as part of the review/approval process. Sprint 4 also contained one final “end to end integration test” story, which allowed our tester to run through the entire MVP application and confirm the end to end functionality delivered across all sprints was working, before calling the product complete.

On two occasions, defects were discovered through testing. When this occurred, the Functional Tester took screenshots of the defects and a bug was logged in JIRA if it could not immediately be addressed.

The bug was assigned to the developer in charge of the original User Story, and once the bug was fixed, the Functional Tester re-tested the story to ensure the prototype was working as intended.

An additional way that the team performed Usability Tests was through the Sprint Demonstration. The agile team provided a demo of the MVP to external users as well as the product owner. Feedback was documented in Confluence, and as the Prototype was developed utilizing an iterative approach, new User Stories were created as an output of the demo and usability testing. Based on the feedback received, these new User Stories made up the bulk of Sprint 3, allowing the project team to deliver a product that better met the end-users’ needs and expectations.
